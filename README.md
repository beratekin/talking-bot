**Talk-to-ChatGPT** is a Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge extension that allows users to talk with the ChatGPT AI using their voice (speech recognition), and listen to the bot's answer with a voice (text-to-speech), rather than just by typing. With this tool, users can speak to the AI and receive spoken responses, making the interaction feel more natural and conversational.
